                    <p>Payscape is an Atlanta based Financial Technology company that offers a suite of FinTech solutions for companies of all sizes. "Our dedication to payment technology and industry innovation is consistent; our mission is clear: to make it simple for business owners to collect money."</p>

                    <h4 class="work__sub-header uppercase">The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>The current Payscape.com was in need of a redesign and restructure. The current look was getting stale, lacked depth, and was showing it's age. While the site lives in WordPress, it is built on a custom theme with limited functionality.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="cell z--1">
                    <h4 class="work__sub-header uppercase">The Solution</h4>
                    <p>From a visual standpoint I embraced current visual trends to bring the look and feel up to modern standards and to better match the updated UX style guide. I Got away from the dated full screen video background to a more traditional lifestyle photograph but with the twist of bright brand colors presented in an overlay. Recruited one of our multi-disciplinary designer/photographers to photograph candid photos around the office.</p>
                    <p>From a techincal standpoint I decided to move the hosting of the site from AWS to a managed WordPress host. This move to a dedicated and managed WordPress host will provide increased security and free up resources as it would take the constant monitoring and updating of a WP site away from the in-house DevOps team.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="cell z--1">
                    <h4 class="work__sub-header uppercase">The Results</h4>
                    <p>With a more visually appealing and streamlined site, I predict increased product trial conversions as well as increased company growth through online recruiting efforts. As mentioned, the move away from AWS will afford increased in-house DevOps resources. The move to a more robust theme will allow additional team members to control and update content.</p>
